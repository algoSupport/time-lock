[Hashed Timelock Contracts](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hashed_Timelock_Contracts) (HTLCs) for Ethereum:

- [HashedTimelock.sol](contracts/HashedTimelock.sol) - HTLC for native ETH token
- [HashedTimelockERC20.sol](contracts/HashedTimelockERC20.sol) - HTLC for ERC20 tokens

Use these contracts for creating HTLCs on the Ethereum side of a cross chain atomic swap (for example the [xcat](https://github.com/chatch/xcat) project).

## Run Tests
Install ganache [https://truffleframework.com/ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache)
Launch and set the network ID to `4447`

```
npm i
truffle test
```

## Interface

### HashedTimelock

1.  `newContract(receiverAddress, hashlock, timelock)` create new HTLC with given receiver, hashlock and expiry; returns contractId bytes32
2.  `withdraw(contractId, preimage)` claim funds revealing the preimage
3.  `refund(contractId)` if withdraw was not called the contract creator can get a refund by calling this some time after the time lock has expired.

See [test/htlc.js](test/htlc.js) for examples of interacting with the contract from javascript.

### HashedTimelockERC20

1.  `newContract(receiverAddress, hashlock, timelock, tokenContract, amount)` create new HTLC with given receiver, hashlock, expiry, ERC20 token contract address and amount of tokens
2.  `withdraw(contractId, preimage)` claim funds revealing the preimage
3.  `refund(contractId)` if withdraw was not called the contract creator can get a refund by calling this some time after the time lock has expired.

See [test/htlcERC20.js](test/htlcERC20.js) for examples of interacting with the contract from javascript.
